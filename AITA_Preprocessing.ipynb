We have no shared interests and we are very different people. I live my life with my chosen family (best friends who are closer than my brother) and my blood brother lives in another city. Whenever we do see one another I feel uncomfortable in his presence: I find him dismissive, arrogant and very unaware of mental health. He once said he thought the cure for mental health was \\u201cmoney in the bank and exercise.\\u201d I tried to tell him how wrong that is but he\\u2019s combative to the point of making the other side give up on putting their perspective across. It\\u2019s not that I hate him: it\\u2019s more that I just can\\u2019t be bothered with the aggro. Or trying to educate somebody that cannot and will not learn. The last time I saw him he was very disrespectful in my home (putting his sweaty feet on my sofa) and then when I asked him to put on socks he refused. This might be a small thing but I struggle with OCD and it\\u2019s just an example of one way in which he disrespects me. \\n\\nAnyway, around three weeks after this, he sent me a long text of demands regarding his engagement party. He took no responsibility for his behaviour over the feet, saying that we would sort \\u201cour differences\\u201d after the engagement party. No apology. I replied to say I would rather step back from it. I find it very difficult to brave face as it is and based on the past, those differences won\\u2019t be sorted. It\\u2019ll just be more of him being combative until the other side (me) gives in.\\n\\nMy parents originally supported our differences but have gradually become more passive aggressive with little comments as they\\u2019ve got upset. They\\u2019re worried about how it will look to other guests if his sibling and their daughter does not attend. They have every right to be excited. It\\u2019s now causing tension between my parents and I as they don\\u2019t respect the fact I\\u2019ve made up my mind and don\\u2019t want to go. I\\u2019ve made it clear I don\\u2019t want a relationship with my brother - now - or ever but they keep guilt tripping me and making me think I\\u2019m being too stubborn. \\nMy Mum ended up making some really unforgivable comments about it. They keep trying to justify his behaviour and tell me I\\u2019ve got him wrong but I haven\\u2019t. I\\u2019ve just learned boundaries in the last few years and I\\u2019m trying to set them. \\n\\nI think weddings should be a place for people you get on with who want to celebrate you. I think I should be allowed to step back without being guilt tripped just because we\\u2019re related. I really have no interest in a long term relationship with him. Don\\u2019t wish him hate, but don\\u2019t want him in my life. \\n\\nAITA?\\n\\nThanks Reddit\\n\\n**\\n\\nCan I just say thank you so much to all of the people who wrote nice, balanced comments. I have been made to feel like I\\u2019m the problem with my family and what seems perfectly rational to me is twisted by them a lot to make me out to be \\u201cpigheaded, stubborn, unreasonable\\u201d etc. It makes me sad as they make me feel like I\\u2019m the crazy one. You\\u2019ve all made me feel a lot better about myself and I appreciate it LOADS \\u2764\\ufe0f\",\n          \"I and three other people were all set to travel to another country for an important business meeting. Our flight had a layover and due to a delay in the first flight, we only had a few minutes to make it from one side of the airport to the other. One of my coworkers, let's call him John, is severely overweight and has difficulty walking fast.\\n\\nAs we ran to catch the flight, John started to fall behind. We all looked back at him, but we were pressed for time and had a meeting to attend. We kept telling him to run, or at least walk faster but he wouldn't and even stopped. We didn't have to go that far, we made it like 5 minutes before boarding closed. We asked the airport staff to wait but they said no.  We made the decision to board the plane without him and texted him to catch the next flight. John was understandably upset and embarrassed that he missed the flight and the meeting.\\n\\nWe attended the meeting without John, apparently he was unable to get another flight.  However, when we returned to work, there was a lot of tension and conflict. John filed a complaint with HR, accusing us of discriminating against him due to his weight and abandoning him at the airport.\\n\\nI understand that it was wrong to leave John behind, but we were under pressure to make it to the meeting on time. We should have helped John or waited for him, but at the moment, we made a bad decision. I apologized to John and offered to make it up to him, but he refused to forgive us. We need to talk to management and HR together. \\n\\nMy other coworkers are angry with me for causing a rift in the team and creating a hostile work environment. John constantly complains and says we are not team players and that we aren't good people.  I feel guilty and ashamed for my behavior and I'm not sure how to make things right. Am I the asshole for leaving John behind at the airport? We otherwise wouldn't have even attended the meeting and we closed an important business dealing\",\n          \"A few months ago, I (28M) joined Hinge.  I matched with this hot redhead, only for her to message me back saying she wouldn\\u2019t be caught dead dating an Amazon delivery driver from (my neighborhood).  I will admit, I don\\u2019t come from money and my mistake was asking out a girl from a richer part of our city.  But that was a low blow.  \\n\\nI couldn\\u2019t report her because she unmatched as soon as she sent the DM. \\n\\nI quit Amazon and got a new job as a baggage handler at the airport.  And lo and behold, the redhead who dumped me works for one of our accounts.  She\\u2019s a grounds agent and didn\\u2019t recognize me.  \\n\\nA few days ago, I overheard her talking to a passenger.  The passenger was about our age and going to Europe to see some guy.  The Redhead asked something like, \\u201cso, how does one get a German boyfriend?\\u201d  \\n\\nI didn\\u2019t like what she said.  So she won\\u2019t go out with a Mexican guy like me, but someone from a rich country is okay? I told her manager that I overheard her making an inappropriate comment to the passenger and they should talk to her.  The manager said she\\u2019ll talk to the Redhead.\\n\\nA few days go by and Red is in a pissed off mood.  She told her coworker she had a meeting with the manager.  Didn\\u2019t say what it was about, but I could guess why.  Nothing happened except a warning not to do it again.\\n\\nI told some friends later over beer and they think what I did was terrible.  I don\\u2019t see how.  She made a jab at my job and my background, so I got back the only way I could.  They won\\u2019t talk to me know, so AITA?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"created_utc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 9579082,\n        \"min\": 1664646465,\n        \"max\": 1700006346,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30978,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1673898973,\n          1689768808,\n          1682191529\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"permalink\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30994,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wq8zf/aita_for_not_serving_meat_at_my_wedding/\",\n          \"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12y326s/aita_for_refusing_to_move_in_because_i_prefer_to/\",\n          \"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15oudz5/aita_for_refusing_to_watch_my_half_siblings_while/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3300,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 48701,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6952,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5034,\n          2562,\n          5879\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They agreed and said it was tasteless. Except that it wasn\\u2019t because of the water. It must have always been tasteless.\\n\\nFriend and roommate then start making a new bolognese because obviously I was wrong. They use the ingredients *I bought* whole the roommate laughs a little while saying \\u201csorry for just taking over :D\\u201d.\\n\\nI\\u2019m not super talkative and leave after dinner saying that I\\u2019m tired and have work the next day anyway. Didn\\u2019t help that they kept saying it was good they made a new one and how impressed they were over they made such a good sauce in only 20 min.\\n\\nFriend texts me a couple of days later and says I owe them an apology for making dinner awkward.\\n\\nYeah, this is of course just my side of the story, and even though I feel that I wasn\\u2019t talkative, I don\\u2019t doubt that my aura must\\u2019ve given off an awkward vibe.\\n\\nI\\u2019m not looking for an apology from them.

In a medium-sized pot, add the lentils and enough water to cover them by approx. 2.5 cm. \\n\\nBring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer the lentils until tender, about 20-30 minutes. \\n\\nDrain the lentils and set them aside.\\n\\nHeat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onion and saut\\u00e9 until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.\\n\\nAdd the very thinly sliced \\u200b\\u200bgarlic cloves to the pan. Cook them until lightly caramelized, about 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent them from burning.\\n\\nAdd mushrooms, carrots and celery to the pan. \\n\\nCook the vegetables, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 10 minutes.\\n\\nAdd the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine (if using), vegetable stock, basil and oregano to the pan. \\n\\nStir to combine the ingredients, then let the sauce simmer for approx. 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.\\n\\nAdd the cooked lentils to the pan. Stir the sauce to combine the lentils with the other ingredients, then continue to simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened to your liking. \\n\\nSeason the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.\\n\\nWhile the sauce is simmering, cook your pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the instructions on the package\\n\\n**Edit** Hadn\\u2019t considered it was done out of pure maliciousness but I was always going to have a real talk with her about this after a cool down period anyway\\u2026 like not via a text.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve cut people out of my life before so it\\u2019s not like I\\u2019m afraid to do that. I just figure that if I upset a friend that much I\\u2019d they\\u2019d give me a chance to have a coffee before completely cutting me out of their lives. Could be a misunderstanding.

He\\u2019s a baby\\u201d.\\n\\n I was confused because I didn\\u2019t say or do anything to indicate I was annoyed ( although I was, very much) I just responded \\u201c I know\\u201d and then she went on a rant at how rude it was for me to make faces when there\\u2019s literally nothing to be done about her child\\u2019s crying. \\n\\nI was baffled and told her that\\u2019s an involuntary reaction to loud noises and I can\\u2019t help it either with her child chewing off my ear. I then told her if she doesn\\u2019t want people to \\u201cmake faces\\u201d she shouldn\\u2019t have brought a goddamn baby on the plane. \\n\\nShe got so mad at that comment and went on a rant about struggling new moms and how I\\u2019m insensitive. I just put in my headphones, that did little to nothing to drown out the noise.\\n\\nWhen we landed I told my parents and siblings about the encounter and they pointed out I may have been too tired to notice but I was rude to this young mother and I could\\u2019ve kept the last comment to myself instead of aggravating her. \\n\\nSo AITA?\",\n          \"So me (27M) and my father (51M) have a rather strained relationship. My father never really wanted children when he was younger and made the mistake of being a father at a young age. He never really abandoned me in a literal sense, but he never really was interested in me, he rarely ever celebrated my  birthday much and often refused to do things with me when I was younger. When I was 15, he married my step-mother and seemed to care more about the family he had with her then the one he had with my mother. \\n\\nI didn't really care much until the age of 19, when he wrote to me over Email that I was no longer in his will because the job I had wasn't respectable enough (At the time I was a cashier) and told me that if he were to bestow one of his sons with inheritance, they had to be successful. I was of course deeply saddened, but I got over it over time and moved on.\\n\\nA few days before Christmas, after years of my Dad not writing or even seeing me, he wrote to me on messenger because I had him blocked on Gmail, Twitter and all apps that had a messaging feature, he  asked if I was interested in reconnecting before 2023. I was skeptical but curious, so I called the number and asked him to explain why now, he explained that he was suffering from Liver Cancer after years of alcoholism, and he wanted to mend our relationship in the case he were to die. I still was pissed about not getting my will, so I refused. But I still feel pretty guilty, what if he is actually dying and I am just being an ass to a dying middle aged man?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"created_utc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 9579823,\n        \"min\": 1664646465,\n        \"max\": 1700006346,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30925,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1697139082,\n          1669734750,\n          1691701720\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"permalink\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30941,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jh5at/aita_for_leaving_a_dinner_i_didnt_want_to_go_to/\",\n          \"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xe650/aita_for_taking_issue_with_an_unleashed_dog_in/\",\n          \"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hnq2d/aita_for_kicking_my_brother_out/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3302,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 48701,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6949,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5034,\n          1194,\n          15940\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30931,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SIL and her poorly behaved child can stay at home.

So I asked my husband if I could get a nanny to just come twice a week or put the kids in a day camp. He\\u2019s against daycare because of the bad reputation it gets and the nanny,  he thinks it can get pricey so he suggested that maybe this upcoming school year I homeschool my eldest and have her help me out. But I really don\\u2019t agree with that, for starters she\\u2019s only 5 and I already feel bad for the little things she does do by keeping her sisters entertained When I\\u2019m busy with housework and lastly, I was homeschooled for the majority of my school years and I honestly hated it and wish I went to public school.\\n\\nMy husband now thinks I\\u2019m not taking into consideration his parenting choices and that I\\u2019m being selfish by not wanting to come to some sort of agreement regarding this.. a lot of people in my life would probably agree with him, so I need an unbiased perspective AITA?\\n\\nEDIT: So many questions!! So for starters I\\u2019m not in any harms way and yes we are part of a religion ..but I don\\u2019t want to make the post strictly about that, also me and my husband both came from big families, (like I\\u2019m 6 of 10 kids ) but I did knew that he would wanted a big family as well, but I just didn\\u2019t think I would be entirely alone doing it or it would just happened so fast. But I appreciate everyone\\u2019s advice and input and  I\\u2019m completely fine I\\u2019m just overwhelmed and tired.\",\n          \"Key info - wife is SAHM. 2 preteen kids. Her mother lives with us. I'm the sole income, as her mother was able to retire because of me. \\n\\nBeen having ongoing issues with money with my MIL. Started as she would go along shopping (always when I was at work) with my wife. She would throw things in with little thought and suddenly they're spending >$500 in a single trip, and going to another grocery store the following day spending $100. \\n\\nDuring the winter, the heat is constantly set around 80. Doors are left open, windows cracked, fans on. Average heat bill during the winter was $600-$900.\\n\\nWe had a water line leak. Suddenly the bill was 3x what is usually was... Except it wasn't suddenly. MIL was notified a year ago about the leak and said nothing. \\n\\nThe other day the MIL took her card to McDonald's and spent $30. \\n\\nThe final straw is she grabbed my wife's bank card to \\\"get a few things\\\". She spent $300 buying things like $35 lunch bags. $20 phone cords. $90 headphones.\\n\\nI've always considered \\\"my\\\" money my wife's also. But now, since her mother apparently thinks it's also her money, I informed the wife I will be opening an account with only my name on it and my checks will be going there from now on. She's more than welcome to use our money freely, however she will need to let me know so I can send it to her. \\n\\nETA - I discussed this with the wife beforehand. She'll say something to her mother and she will go out of her way to make my wife's life hell, and after awhile just go right back to the same behavior \\n\\nETA2 - Wife in no way has to justify what she wants or \\\"ask\\\" for money. She can always reach me, no matter what. All she has to do is tell me how much she wants and she will get it. She also has a couple of credit cards \\n\\nTL;DR - MIL has been helping herself to wife and I's joint bank account. I am going to no longer deposit to that account unless the wife lets me know she needs or wants money for whatever reason\",\n          \"A bit of background first. My friend group and I all live in the same city that I grew up in. Most of us went to college together in the city, which is where we all met. I moved a state away after graduating college, but recently moved back and reconnected with everyone. Since moving, the group has expanded and branched out a whole lot, which I love because it's been so easy to make new friends.\\n\\nNow, I'm a huge fan of girls' nights. I just love them and all the positive energy, and me or one of our other friends like to host them every few weeks. I'm hosting one tonight, and I sent out a reminder text to all the girls about it this morning. \\n\\nA few hours later, I got a text from my best friend Sophie's boyfriend. I'll call him Brad (fake name). He went to college with us, but he and I weren't really that close until he and Sophie started dating. He asked me why he wasn't invited to the party tonight. I told him that it wasn't a party, just a casual get-together. It's going to be the most stereotypical \\\"girls' night in\\\" (painting our nails and watching a rom-com) and he wouldn't want to come anyway. He said it hurt his feelings that he wasn't invited, and he thought that I should have invited everyone and done something more inclusionary, like watching a Marvel movie. I said that wasn't the point of a girls' night. He said girls' nights were sexist, and that I was being hypocritical because my roommate, James, a high school friend of mine, was going to be there. \\n\\nI had to go, so I ended the conversation there, but I told him that I wasn't changing my mind. But then later I got several texts from him and a couple of the other guys, saying it wasn't fair that we were hanging out without them, and that they had always felt left out and not really part of the group because we were always doing things without them. \\n\\nI texted Brad back and told him that it was my apartment, it was ridiculous to expect me to invite everyone to everything, and that if he wanted to be invited to things so badly, there was nothing stopping him and the other boys from doing \\\"boys' nights\\\". He called me an asshole and a bad friend, and implied that I'd \\\"ruined\\\" the friend group by coming back. \\n\\nNow I'm really mad, but also confused. James is supporting me (he says he believes in the power of girls' nights) but says I was a little bit of an asshole about it, and should have addressed Brad's feelings more instead of shutting him down so immediately. Now I feel bad, but I'm also confused as to why the boys are all upset about not being invited to girl's nights now, when we've been doing them since college. It's also just not practical to invite 20-30 people to every single thing. But there's a lot of people who I've only met since moving back, and maybe the dynamics have shifted since then.\\n\\nAm I wrong? Do I need to apologize? It's a little too late to change plans for tonight, but should I try to organize something for everyone?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"created_utc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 9579306,\n        \"min\": 1666931031,\n        \"max\": 1700006346,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30911,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1672070517,\n          1694271626,\n          1671228002\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"permalink\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30927,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1318uj6/aita_for_not_wanting_to_subsidize_my_brothers/\",\n          \"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135crk8/aita_for_not_lending_my_brother_money_to_save_his/\",\n          \"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15novq2/aita_for_not_telling_my_ex_the_truth_about_my_son/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3302,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 48701,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6949,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5034,\n          1194,\n          15940\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30917,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"NTA.
